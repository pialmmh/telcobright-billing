<p>This is an experimental release intended to test new features for Wireshark 4.4.</p>

<h2 id="_what_is_wireshark">What is Wireshark?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer.
It is used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.</p>

<h2 id="_whats_new">What’s New</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Improved display filter support for value strings (optional string
representations for numeric fields).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Display filter functions can be implemented as runtime-loadable C plugins.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Plugin registration API was refactored. Plugin authors must update their
plugins as described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many other improvements have been made.
See the “New and Updated Features” section below for more details.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_new_and_updated_features">New and Updated Features</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following features are new (or have been significantly updated) since version 4.2.0:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Display filter syntax-related enhancements:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Better handling of comparisons with value strings. Now the display filter engine can
correctly handle cases where multiple different numeric values map to the same value
string, including but not limited to range-type value strings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fields with value strings now support regular expression matching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Date and time values now support arithmetic, with some restrictions:
the multiplier/divisor must be an integer or float and appear on the right-hand
side of the operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The keyword "bitand" can be used as an alternative syntax for the bitwise-and operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions alone can now be used as an entire logical expression.
The result of the expression is the truthiness of the function return
value (or of all values if more than one). This is useful for example to write
"len(something)" instead of "len(something) != 0". Even more so if a function
returns itself a boolean value, it is now possible to write
"bool_test(some.field)" instead of having to write "bool_test(some.field) == True"
(both forms are now valid).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display filter references can be written without curly braces. It
is now possible to write <code>$frame.number</code> instead of <code>${frame.number}</code> for example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added new display filter functions to test various IP address properties.
Check the wireshark-filter(5) manpage for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display filter macros can be written using a function-like notation.
The macro <code>${mymacro:arg1; &#8230;&#8203;; argN}</code> can be written
$mymacro(arg1, &#8230;&#8203;, argN)`.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display filter functions can be implemented as libwireshark plugins. Plugins are loaded
during startup from the usual binary plugin configuration directories. See the
<code>ipaddr.c</code> source file in the distribution for an example of a display filter C plugin
and the doc/plugins.example folder for generic instructions how to build a plugin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display filter autocompletions now also include display filter functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The display filter macro configuration file has changed format. It now uses
the same format as the "dfilters" file and has been renamed accordingly to
"dmacros". Internally it no longer uses the UAT API and the display filter macro
GUI dialog has been updated. There is some basic migration logic implemented
but it is advisable to check that the "dfilter_macros" (old) and
"dmacros" (new) files in the profile directory are consistent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When selecting "Manage Interfaces" from "Capture Options", Wireshark only
attempts to reconnect to rpcap (remote) hosts that were connected to in the
last session, instead of every remote host that the current profile has ever
connected to. <a href="https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/issues/17484">Issue 17484</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding interfaces at startup is about twice as fast, and has many fewer
UAC pop-ups when npcap is installed with access restricted to Administrators
on Windows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Resolved Addresses dialog only shows what addresses and ports are
present in the file (not including information from static files), and
selected rows or the entire table can be saved or copied to the clipboard
in several formats.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New <span class="menuseq"><b class="menu">Tools</b>&#160;<b class="caret">&#8250;</b> <b class="menuitem">Install Plugin</b></span> option provides a convenient method to install
a binary plugin to the personal folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The personal binary plugins folder now has higher priority than the global
folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The binary plugins folder path no longer uses an X.Y version component. Plugins
are required to add the ABI version to the file name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_removed_features_and_support">Removed Features and Support</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The tshark <code>-G</code> option with no argument is deprecated and will be removed in
a future version. Use <code>tshark -G fields</code> to produce the same report.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_new_protocol_support">New Protocol Support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EGNOS Message Server (EMS) file format, MAC NR Framed (mac-nr-framed), RF4CE Network Layer (RF4CE), and RF4CE Profile (RF4CE Profile)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_updated_protocol_support">Updated Protocol Support</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>IPv6: The "show address detail" preference is now enabled by default. The
address details provided have been extended to include more special purpose address
block properties (forwardable, globally-routable, etc).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Too many other protocol updates have been made to list them all here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>EGNOS Messager Server (EMS) files</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_major_api_changes">Major API Changes</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plugin registration API was refactored. Plugin authors must do the following:
1 - Remove the existing boilerplate (version, want_major` and <code>want_minor</code> and
plugin API declarations. 2 - Add a struct ws_module to the plugin.
3 - Call one of the WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_REGISTER_* macros. See README.plugins
sections 5 and doc/plugins.example/hello.c for details and examples.</p>
